# UK payment practices analysis

## Installation

The code was written in Python 2 and requires the following packages: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Motivation

Late payments remain a contentious issue for many small and medium-sized enterprises. Big businesses often impose protracted terms or delay payments beyond what was agreed as it gives them access to cheap credit for working capital. It's common practice, but failing to pay suppliers on time can have adverse affects for cash-flow, impact the suppliers' ability to trade and in severe cases risks businesses' solvency. In the UK alone it has been estimated that £26 billion is tied up in late supplier payments owed to SMEs. Prompt payment could prevent 50,000 businesses' deaths each year, which cost £2.5 billion to the UK economy.

To crack down on late payment practices, the UK Government introduced legislation in April 2017, requiring that large UK companies and limited liability partnerships publish twice-yearly reports on their payment performance and policies. Failure to comply with these rules is a criminal offence and can result in a hefty fine.

The motivation behind this analysis is to explore these published reports in order to better understand the payment practices of UK big business. In particular we wish to answer the following questions:

* What is the average time for a company to pay?
* What proportopn of invoices are paid late?
* How about those companies that have signed up to the Prompt Payment Code?
* Do companies that offer financial solutions perform better?
* Are we seeing any improvements over time?
